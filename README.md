# arm32v7-keycloak
Simple container for the Keycloak to run on a RPI. 

For currently unknown reasons, Keycloak seems to hang without errors during startup whereas the same setup on ubuntu 18.04 has no problems during initialisation.

Therefore, this currently does not work (but theoretically should). :(
